# x-to-machine-learning
there are lots of guides to quickly get started with machine learning - maybe too many - or maybe there are just enough?

it is hard to tell... 

this is an attempt to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and help make tools relevant to YOU more discoverable.

but how you ask? 

well for everyone who has made the journey to machine learning, they have something to share about that 

there are as many unique path to machine learning, each from a mind that is curious about it 

here the goal is to provide an easy way for resources to be shared according to overlapping paths - to develop road maps for those with common backgrounds, to help navigate popular resources in a more effective way, relevant to an individual's personal context
